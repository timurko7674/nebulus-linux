# Nebulus Linux

Welcome to Nebulus. It’s a pretty easy-to-setup and powerful Arch-based OS. It’s not *exactly* made just for people switching from Windows, but honestly, it’s way easier to use than vanilla Arch.

Nebulus gives you a smooth experience with a clean interface, so you don’t have to spend hours messing around just to get things working.

## What’s Nebulus?

So, Nebulus is built on Arch Linux — which is powerful but kinda complicated if you’re new to Linux. I wanted to make it simpler, but still keep that Arch power and flexibility.

It’s great if you want something fast, lightweight, and customizable without going through the usual Arch installation pain.

## Why Use Nebulus?

If you’ve ever thought “I want Arch, but not the hassle,” Nebulus is made for you. It’s Arch Linux underneath but with scripts and setups that get you running quicker.

Plus, the desktop is easy on the eyes and kinda familiar if you’re coming from Windows, so it won’t feel too alien.

## What You Get

- **Easy to Use Interface:** Clean and simple, without all the confusing stuff.
- **Fast & Lightweight:** Runs smooth on most hardware.
- **Rolling Updates:** Always up-to-date with the latest software.
- **Customizable:** Change how things look and work however you want.
- **Pre-installed Apps:** Comes with basic tools like browsers, media players, and dev stuff.
- **Good Hardware Support:** Works well with most modern computers.
- **Easy Scripts Folder:** If you don’t know how to do basic commands like `sudo pacman -Syu` or other stuff, there’s a folder included with simple scripts to help you out. Just run them and you’re good.

## Installing Nebulus

Installing Nebulus is easier than normal Arch — I made scripts to handle the boring stuff like partitioning and setup, so you don’t have to.
